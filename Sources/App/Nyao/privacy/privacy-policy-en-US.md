# Nyao Privacy Policy (United States)

Effective Date: 2026-02-15  
Last Updated: 2026-02-15

This Privacy Policy explains how KIM MINGUK ("Operator," "we," "us," or "our") handles personal information in the Nyao app (the "App").

Most drawing data in Nyao (such as canvas files, imported images, custom brushes, and settings) is processed and stored locally on your device. We may collect limited diagnostic and analytics information to improve app reliability and quality.  


## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information collected automatically

- Crash and diagnostic data (Firebase Crashlytics)
  - Examples: crash logs, stack traces, device and OS information, app version, diagnostic performance data.
- Usage analytics data (Firebase Analytics)
  - Examples: app usage events, session data, device/app identifiers.  

### B. Information you provide voluntarily

- Contact information you provide when sending us an email inquiry
  - Examples: your email address, message content, and any attachments you choose to include.

### C. Local-only data

- Canvas files, imported images, custom brush files, and in-app settings are generally stored on your device and are not uploaded by us to our own servers.


## 2. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- diagnose crashes and improve app stability,
- understand usage and improve features,
- respond to support requests and resolve issues,
- comply with legal obligations and protect the App.  


## 3. Sharing and Service Providers

We do not sell personal information and we do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

We may share limited information with service providers that process data on our behalf to operate the App:

- Google LLC (Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics)  


## 4. International Data Transfers

Because Firebase services are operated by Google LLC, information may be processed in the United States and other jurisdictions where Google or its infrastructure providers operate.  


## 5. Data Retention

- Crash/diagnostic and analytics data: retained as needed for the purposes described above, and subject to applicable law and Firebase retention settings/policies.
- Support emails and related content: retained until the request is resolved, then deleted within a reasonable period unless a longer retention period is required by law.
- Local files/settings: remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.  


## 6. Your Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including rights to access, correct, delete, and request limitations on certain processing.

Residents of certain U.S. states may have additional rights under applicable state privacy laws.

To exercise rights, contact us at: [alsrnr315@gmail.com](mailto:alsrnr315@gmail.com)  


## 7. Security

We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.  


## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through appropriate channels, such as in-app notice, App Store listing updates, or release notes.
